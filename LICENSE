KAGGLE COMPETITION DATA ACCESS AND USE STATEMENT
We have read and agree to the [rules of the Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/rules).
We follow the rules because we have only uploaded form one team account and have not 
used nor shared private code or data to another team. All we have is public to 
anyone who wants to access to it.

We used this licence since the data and inspiration to the code comes from free public
acces of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) so the use and distribution of it is
also free and public for everyone.
